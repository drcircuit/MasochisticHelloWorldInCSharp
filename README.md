Design pattern addict abuses design patterns to implement Hello World.

An example to show people that design patterns should (almost) always come after the implementation. 
It is better to refactor into patterns, than to start out to try and create the ultimate grand design.
Simplicity eats perceived architecture for breakfast, and it is when, and only when the requirements change, making the simple implementations insufficient or obsolete that you should consider patterns. Patterns emerge from solutions, they don't start out as them.
